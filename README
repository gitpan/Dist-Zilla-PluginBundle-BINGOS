NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::BINGOS - BeLike::BINGOS when you build your
    dists

VERSION
    version 0.18

SYNOPSIS
       # in dist.ini
       [@BINGOS]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Dist::Zilla PluginBundle. It is roughly equivalent to the
    following dist.ini:

      [@Basic]

      [MetaJSON]
      [PodSyntaxTests]
      [PodCoverageTests]

      [PodWeaver]
      [PkgVersion]
      [GithubMeta]

      [ChangelogFromGit]
      file_name = Changes
      tag_regexp = ^(\\d+\\.\\d+)$
      max_age = 1825

      [ReadmeFromPod]
      [Test::Compile]

      [Clean]

    This PluginBundle also supports PluginRemover, so dropping a plugin is
    as easy as this:

       [@BINGOS]
       -remove = PluginIDontWant

  METHODS
    "configure"
        See Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Role::Easy.
